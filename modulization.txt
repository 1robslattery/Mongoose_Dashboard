Part 1:

Although this is about modulization, it's good to know how to start a new project.
-	Create a project directory; i.e., mkdir project_name
-	CD into new project directory.
-	Open terminal shell & change directory into new project directory.
-	type:  npm init -y
-	Within new shell type: sudo mongod
-	Within new shell type: mongo
-	Within new shell type: npm init express ejs mongoose --save

Part 2:

-	Create a Views folder.
-	Create a Server folder
	-	Create subfolders named controllers, models, utils.

-	Models Folder: This folder will contain all of the items that would contain attributes.
	This should remind you of a python models folder.


Part 4:

The final step is to start your server and access your project through the browser.
-	Within terminal, change directory into your new project.
-	Type: nodemon server.js
-	Access your application through the browser; i.e., http://localhost.8000
